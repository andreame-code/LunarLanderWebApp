# Lunar Lander Web App

This repository contains a simple web version of the **Lunar Lander** game. It simulates the lunar module descent phase of the Apollo missions. The objective is to land the module safely on the Moon’s surface by controlling a single thruster.

## How the game works

- The lunar module starts at an altitude of **100 m** with zero initial vertical velocity.
- Every **0.1 s** the simulation updates velocity and altitude by applying the Moon’s gravitational acceleration. When the thruster is on, an additional upward acceleration is applied and fuel is consumed.
- You control the thruster by pressing and holding the **“Hold to Thrust”** button. The thruster fires as long as you hold the button and fuel remains. When fuel runs out, the thruster shuts off automatically.
- The game ends when the altitude reaches zero. If the module’s speed is **≤ 2 m/s** upon touchdown, you land successfully; otherwise, the lander crashes.
- After landing or crashing, a **Restart** button appears to start a new attempt.

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **`index.html`** | Main HTML page that defines the UI structure. |
| **`style.css`** | Basic styling for the page, buttons and text. |
| **`script.js`** | Contains all game logic, physics updates and event handlers. |

## Running locally

Open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) to play. No server or installation is required because the game is built entirely with client‑side HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

## Notes

This version is designed to mirror the behaviour of the watchOS game by focusing on core physics and simple controls. Feel free to extend it by adding graphics,
