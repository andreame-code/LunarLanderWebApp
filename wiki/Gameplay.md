# Gameplay

The goal is to land the lunar module softly on the Moon's surface.

## Controls

- **Up Arrow / ▲** – Fires the main engine to slow descent.
- **Left Arrow / ◀** – Fires the left thruster to move the lander left.
- **Right Arrow / ▶** – Fires the right thruster to move the lander right.
- Thrusters consume fuel while active. When fuel runs out, thrusters shut off automatically.

You can also use the on‑screen buttons on mobile devices. Each control stays active while the key or button is held.

## Landing Conditions

- The lander starts 100 m above the surface with zero velocity.
- Every 0.1 s the simulation updates velocity and altitude, applying lunar gravity and any active thrusters.
- Touchdown occurs when altitude reaches zero.
- If vertical speed is **≤ 2 m/s** at touchdown you land safely; otherwise the lander crashes.
- After landing or crashing a **Restart** button lets you try again.
