# Lunar Lander Web App Wiki

Welcome to the documentation hub for the **Lunar Lander Web App**. This wiki expands on the README and provides details about gameplay mechanics, the underlying physics model, and how to develop the project locally.

## Pages

- [Gameplay](Gameplay.md) – learn how to pilot the lander and achieve a safe touchdown.
- [Physics](Physics.md) – dive into the simulation that powers gravity, thrust, and fuel consumption.
- [Development](Development.md) – guidance on running the app, tests, and building for production.

## Project Overview

The Lunar Lander Web App simulates the descent phase of a lunar module. Starting from 100 m above the surface with zero initial velocity, you must apply thrust carefully to reduce speed and land gently. Exceed the safe landing speed of 2 m/s and the module will crash.

Happy landing!
